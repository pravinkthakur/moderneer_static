# CRITICAL: Browser Cache Issue

## The Problem
You're seeing an error for `generateNarrative is not defined` even though:
- ✅ The function WAS added to boot.js
- ✅ Changes were committed (0fe70eb)
- ✅ Changes were pushed to GitHub
- ✅ GitHub Pages has deployed the new file
- ✅ The function EXISTS in the live file at https://moderneer.co.uk/assessment/src/app/boot.js

**The issue:** Your browser is serving OLD CACHED JavaScript that doesn't have the function.

## Why This Happened

Browsers aggressively cache JavaScript files for performance. Even though GitHub Pages deployed the new file, your browser is still using the old cached version. A normal refresh (F5) doesn't always clear JavaScript cache - you need a **hard refresh** to force the browser to download the latest files.

## Alternative: Disable Cache During Development

In Chrome/Edge DevTools:
1. Open DevTools (F12)
2. Go to Network tab
3. Check "Disable cache"
4. Keep DevTools open while testing

This prevents caching while you're actively developing/testing.

**Action Required:** Please do a hard refresh now (Ctrl+Shift+R) and try clicking the report button again.
