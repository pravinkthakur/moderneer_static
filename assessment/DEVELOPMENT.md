# Moderneer Assessment - Development

## Quick Test (No Build Required)

Since this is a static site with ES6 modules, you can test it directly:

1. **Using VS Code Live Server:**
   - Install "Live Server" extension
   - Right-click on `index.html` 
   - Select "Open with Live Server"

2. **Using Python:**
   ```bash
   cd assessment
   python -m http.server 3000
   ```

3. **Using Node.js:**
   ```bash
   cd assessment  
   npx http-server . -p 3000 -o
   ```

## Full Development Setup

If you want the full development experience with hot reload and build tools:

```bash
cd assessment
npm install
npm run dev
```
