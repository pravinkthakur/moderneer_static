# Assessment Module

## Vision
Moderneer is a framework and SaaS toolkit that helps organisations move beyond Agile toward Outcome Engineering â€” a measurable discipline aligning engineering effort with business outcomes.

## Purpose
The Assessment module delivers the outcome engineering maturity assessment. It loads configuration, pillars, and detailed checks from API endpoints. Assessment scores will be exported as PKP artifacts in v2.

## Architecture
- **Static frontend** hosted on GitHub Pages
- **API-first** - all data from api.assessment.config.moderneer.co.uk
- **Version 8.1.0** - Clean architecture with cache-busting
